# Code Style Guidelines

## Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where helpful
- Docstrings for all classes and public methods
- Keep functions small and focused

## Naming Conventions

- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/methods: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

## Error Handling

- Use try/except for external API calls
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Gracefully handle network failures
- Don't crash on invalid input

## Comments

- Explain why, not what
- Keep comments up to date
- Use docstrings for public APIs
- Avoid obvious comments
